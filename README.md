# ATAC-seq Reveals an Isl1 Enhancer that Regulates Sinoatrial Node Development and Function - GWAS Code

Vedantham Lab

The purpose of this analysis was to test whether SNPs located in proximity to genomic region syntenic to ATAC-seq peaks identified in mouse atrial cardiomyocytes and pacemaker cells are associated with resting heart rate in UK Biobank subjects.
