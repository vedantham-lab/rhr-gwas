To determine SNPs which correlate with variations in Resting Heart Rate, we conducted GWAS controlling for BMI, Sex, Age, and 10 Principal Components. We decided to conduct our own GWAS, rather than use the results of other papers, because the lack of publicly available data on all SNPs from these studies, rather than just statistically significant ones. We also wanted to control for BMI, which other papers did not. 

This repository contains code used to conduct our analysis.
